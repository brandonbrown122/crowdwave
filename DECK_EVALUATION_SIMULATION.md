## Phase 2: Anchoring Priors

| Construct | Source | Relevance | Finding | Weight |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Executive attention span for decks | McKinsey/HBR research | 5 | Execs spend avg 2-3 min on first pass; decide interest in first 3 slides | High |
| Consulting deck expectations | Analyst Academy, Slideworks | 4 | Action titles, one message per slide, visual proof points, clear ask | High |
| AI/ML tool skepticism | Gartner 2025 | 4 | 67% of execs skeptical of AI accuracy claims without validation proof | High |
| Research budget decision makers | Greenbook/GRIT 2025 | 4 | Cost and speed are top 2 decision factors; accuracy is table stakes | Medium |
| B2B deck conversion rates | SalesHacker/Gong research | 3 | Strong decks convert at 15-25%; weak decks <5% | Medium |

## Phase 5: Ensemble Simulation

### Q1: Overall deck quality rating (1-10 scale)

| Rating | Run1 (Conservative) | Run2 (Signal-forward) | Run3 (Heterogeneity) | Final |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1-4 (Poor) | 8% | 5% | 12% | 8% |
| 5-6 (Average) | 35% | 25% | 30% | 30% |
| 7-8 (Good) | 45% | 50% | 40% | 46% |
| 9-10 (Excellent) | 12% | 20% | 18% | 16% |

**Mean: 6.8 | Target for "excellent": 8.0+**

### Q2: Would you take a follow-up meeting? (Yes/No)

| Response | Run1 | Run2 | Run3 | Final |
|----------|------|------|------|-------|
| Yes | 55% | 65% | 58% | 59% |
| No | 45% | 35% | 42% | 41% |

**Target: 70%+ for strong deck**

### Q3: What's missing or weak? (Open-end themes)

| Theme | Frequency | Representative Quote |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Need real client examples/case studies** | 42% | "Nice methodology, but show me someone who used this and got results" |
| **Pricing/ROI unclear** | 28% | "What does this actually cost? What's my expected return?" |
| **Too much methodology, not enough business impact** | 24% | "I don't care how it works, I care what it does for my team" |
| **Competitive comparison missing** | 18% | "How is this different from Dig Insights, Zappi, or just using ChatGPT?" |
| **Implementation unclear** | 15% | "How long to get started? Who runs it?" |

### Q4: Strongest elements (Open-end themes)

| Theme | Frequency | Representative Quote |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Clear accuracy proof** | 48% | "The 27 test cases with sources is compelling" |
| **Speed/cost comparison visual** | 35% | "3 vs 50 tests per quarter — that's a clear value prop" |
| **Bias correction framework** | 28% | "The senior tech correction is smart — shows they know the limits" |
| **Decision matrix** | 22% | "Appreciate the honesty about when NOT to use it" |

### Q5: Credibility rating (1-10)

| Rating | Run1 | Run2 | Run3 | Final |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1-4 | 5% | 3% | 8% | 5% |
| 5-6 | 25% | 20% | 28% | 24% |
| 7-8 | 50% | 52% | 45% | 49% |
| 9-10 | 20% | 25% | 19% | 22% |

**Mean: 7.2 | Above average for new vendor**

## Phase 7: Confidence Calibration

| Question | Confidence | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Overall quality | 0.75 | Strong priors on exec deck expectations; runs agreed within 8pts |
| Follow-up meeting | 0.70 | B2B conversion data available but variable by context |
| Missing elements | 0.80 | Consistent themes across runs; aligns with known exec concerns |
| Credibility | 0.75 | Strong priors on AI skepticism patterns |

## Key Findings & Improvement Actions

### Current State: 6.8/10 (Good, not Excellent)

### Gap to Excellent (8.0+):

1. **Add client proof** (-1.0 pt gap)
   - Need at least 1 case study or named client
   - "Company X tested 47 concepts in 2 weeks, validated top 3, launched winner"
   - Even anonymized: "A Fortune 500 CPG company..."

2. **Add business impact slide** (-0.5 pt gap)
   - ROI calculation: "If you run 10 additional concept tests at $0 marginal cost..."
   - Time-to-market advantage quantified
   - Risk reduction (killing bad ideas earlier)

3. **Reduce methodology, increase outcome** (-0.3 pt gap)
   - Cut technical slides (bias corrections can go to appendix)
   - Lead with "what you get" before "how it works"

4. **Add competitive positioning** (-0.2 pt gap)
   - Brief comparison: traditional vs. DIY AI vs. Crowdwave
   - Why calibration matters vs. raw ChatGPT

5. **Add implementation clarity** (-0.2 pt gap)
   - "Day 1: Integration call | Week 1: First simulation | Week 2: Validated results"

1. **Title** — Crowdwave
2. **Executive Summary** — SCR (keep)
3. **The Problem** — Speed gap visual (keep, stronger)
4. **The Proof** — 27 tests, 1.9pt error (keep)
5. **NEW: Case Study** — Real client result
6. **NEW: Business Impact** — ROI calculation
7. **Accuracy Zones** — When to use (keep, simplified)
8. **Decision Matrix** — Stakes framework (keep)
9. **Competitive Edge** — Why not DIY/ChatGPT
10. **Implementation** — Timeline to value
11. **The Ask** — 3 actions (keep)
