# Crowdwave Pilot Test 4: Executive Audience (C-Suite)
## February 7, 2026 — 9:40 PM CST

### Test Design
Executive audiences are a KNOWN GAP. This test documents what we predicted vs. actual to understand the calibration deficit.

**Source:** Conference Board C-Suite Survey (N=1,732 global, N=637 US)

## PHASE 1: PREDICTIONS (Using Consumer Calibrations)

### Q1: Top Economic Concerns (US Executives)

**Predictions using general calibrations:**

| Factor | Consumer-Based Prediction | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Recession concern | 40-45% | High baseline in uncertain times |
| Uncertainty concern | 25-30% | General anxiety factor |
| Tariffs concern | 15-20% | Trade issue, moderate salience |
| Inflation concern | 20-25% | Declining but still present |

---

### Q2: Top Geopolitical Concerns (US Executives)

**Predictions using general calibrations:**

| Factor | Consumer-Based Prediction | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Cyberattacks | 35-40% | Growing concern, but not dominant |
| Uncertainty | 35-40% | Parallel to economic uncertainty |
| Social unrest | 20-25% | Background concern |

---

### Q3: Societal/Tech Factors (US Executives)

**Predictions using general calibrations:**

| Factor | Consumer-Based Prediction | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------|
| AI concern | 28-32% | Apply ×0.90 dampening |
| Political polarization | 25-30% | Elevated but not top |
| Consumer behavior shifts | 30-35% | Business-relevant |

---

## PHASE 2: ACTUAL RESULTS (US Executives, N=637)

### Economic Concerns

| Factor | Predicted | Actual | Error | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Uncertainty | 25-30% | **46.1%** | 16+ pts | ❌ MAJOR MISS |
| Recession | 40-45% | 38.5% | 2 pts | ✅ PASS |
| Tariffs | 15-20% | 30.0% | 10+ pts | ❌ MISS |
| Inflation | 20-25% | 14.8% | 5-10 pts | ❌ MISS |

### Geopolitical Concerns

| Factor | Predicted | Actual | Error | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Cyberattacks | 35-40% | **60.5%** | 20+ pts | ❌ MAJOR MISS |
| Uncertainty | 35-40% | 54.5% | 15+ pts | ❌ MAJOR MISS |
| Social unrest | 20-25% | 34.4% | 10+ pts | ❌ MISS |

### Societal/Tech Factors

| Factor | Predicted | Actual | Error | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| AI concern | 28-32% | **40.4%** | 8+ pts | ❌ MISS |
| Political polarization | 25-30% | 31.9% | 2 pts | ✅ PASS |
| Consumer behavior | 30-35% | 23.3% | 7+ pts | ❌ MISS |

## RESULTS SUMMARY

| Category | Tests | Pass | Miss | Major Miss (>15 pts) |
|----------|-------|------|------|---------------------|
| Economic | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 |
| Geopolitical | 3 | 0 | 3 | 2 |
| Societal | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| **Total** | **10** | **2** | **8** | **3** |

**Pass rate:** 20%
**Mean absolute error:** 9.8 points
**Major misses (>15 pts):** 3 of 10

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Consumer Calibrations Fail for Executives:

1. **Cyberattacks (+20 pts):** Executives have direct responsibility for cyber risk. Personal stakes much higher than general public.

2. **Uncertainty (+16 pts):** Executives face decision paralysis from uncertainty. General public can "wait and see" — executives cannot.

3. **Tariffs (+10 pts):** Direct business impact. Consumers feel tariffs indirectly; executives manage supply chains.

4. **AI concern (+8 pts):** Executives worried about disruption to business models. General public worried about jobs.

5. **Inflation (−10 pts):** Executives have more inflation hedging tools. Less personal concern despite business awareness.

## CALIBRATION GAPS IDENTIFIED

| Factor | Consumer Baseline | Executive Multiplier Needed |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Cyberattacks | 35-40% | **×1.5 to ×1.7** |
| Uncertainty | 25-30% | **×1.6 to ×1.8** |
| Tariffs/Trade | 15-20% | **×1.5 to ×1.6** |
| AI disruption | 28-32% | **×1.3 to ×1.4** |
| Social unrest | 20-25% | **×1.4 to ×1.5** |

---

## CONCLUSION

**Executive audience requires separate calibration layer.**

Consumer-based predictions fail because:
- Executives have different risk exposure
- Decision-making responsibility elevates concern levels
- Business context changes relevance weighting

**Recommended action:**
- Build executive calibration multipliers from Conference Board data
- Do NOT use consumer calibrations for C-suite audiences
- Flag executive questions for validation until calibration complete

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

This test **intentionally demonstrates failure** to validate the known gap.

**What we learned:**
- Average error of 9.8 pts for executives vs. 1.4 pts for consumers
- Consumer calibrations cannot transfer to executive audiences
- Need dedicated executive calibration effort

**Status:** Executive domain marked as LOW CONFIDENCE in accuracy claims.
