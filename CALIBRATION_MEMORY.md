# CALIBRATION MEMORY

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE
**Only calibrate from HUMAN data. Never from other simulations.**

Comparing simulations shows methodology alignment, but does NOT validate accuracy.
Only real human responses can be used to derive calibration multipliers.

## SIMULATION COMPARISONS (NOT FOR CALIBRATION) ⚠️

### InStride Health Messaging Study
**Source:** Crowdwave simulation (not human data)
**Status:** ⚠️ COMPARISON ONLY — DO NOT USE FOR CALIBRATION

Observations (methodology alignment, not validation):
- My simulation predicted Option C wins — Crowdwave agreed
- Differences noted: I was more optimistic on motivation, less concerned on barriers
- These differences show methodology gap, NOT ground truth

### CEO Survey 2026
**Source:** Crowdwave simulation (not human data)  
**Status:** ⚠️ COMPARISON ONLY — DO NOT USE FOR CALIBRATION

Observations (methodology alignment, not validation):
- Generally aligned on major themes (AI, cyberattacks, etc.)
- I weighted tariffs higher, Crowdwave weighted political uncertainty higher
- Cannot determine who is correct without human data

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

### Before Running a Simulation:
1. Check if audience matches a HUMAN-VALIDATED segment
2. If yes, apply the multipliers from that segment
3. If no direct match, check for similar demographics
4. If no match, use conservative base calibrations only

### After Getting Human Validation Data:
1. Compute actual vs predicted for each metric
2. Calculate multipliers (actual / predicted)
3. Add new entry to HUMAN-VALIDATED section
4. Update derived modifiers

### What NOT To Do:
- ❌ Do not calibrate from Crowdwave or other LLM simulations
- ❌ Do not treat simulation comparisons as validation
- ❌ Do not derive multipliers from non-human sources
