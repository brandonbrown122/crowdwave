Overview
 
We
 
tested
 
two
 
value
 
proposition
 
messages
 
for
 
InStride
 
Health,
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
Option
 
A
 
and
 
Option
 
C
 
(details
 
in
 
the
 
Addendum),
 
to
 
understand
 
which
 
more
 
effectively
 
motivates
 
parents
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
next
 
step
 
toward
 
care
 
for
 
a
 
child
 
experiencing
 
anxiety .
 
 
This
 
was
 
a
 
head-to-head
 
comparison
 
conducted
 
using
 
a
 
simulated
 
audience
 
of
 
100
 
parents
 
modeled
 
to
 
reflect
 
InStride’ s
 
target
 
decision-makers.
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
simulation
 
was
 
to
 
provide
 
directional
 
guidance
 
on
 
relative
 
message
 
performance.
 
 
Simulated
 
parents
 
reviewed
 
both
 
messages
 
and
 
responded
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
set
 
of
 
questions
 
assessing
 
motivation,
 
concern
 
about
 
pursuing
 
care,
 
perceived
 
differentiation,
 
and
 
likelihood
 
to
 
take
 
action.
 
They
 
then
 
selected
 
which
 
option
 
would
 
make
 
them
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
next
 
step.

Executive
 
Summary
 
and
 
Recommendation
 
●
 
Option
 
C
 
clearly
 
outperformed
 
Option
 
A
 
and
 
is
 
the
 
recommended
 
value
 
proposition
 
●
 
When
 
asked
 
which
 
message
 
would
 
make
 
them
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
next
 
step,
 
Option
 
C
 
was
 
chosen
 
by
 
roughly
 
twice
 
as
 
many
 
parents
 
as
 
Option
 
A
 
(50%
 
vs
 
24%),
 
with
 
18%
 
saying
 
the
 
options
 
felt
 
about
 
the
 
same
 
and
 
8%
 
indicating
 
they
 
were
 
not
 
sure
 
●
 
This
 
preference
 
aligns
 
with
 
Option
 
C’s
 
stronger
 
performance
 
on
 
motivation
 
and
 
perceived
 
differentiation
 
●
 
Option
 
A
 
performed
 
well
 
on
 
tone
 
and
 
reassurance
 
and
 
slightly
 
reduced
 
concern
 
for
 
some
 
parents.
 
However ,
 
these
 
advantages
 
did
 
not
 
translate
 
into
 
greater
 
likelihood
 
to
 
act.
 
In
 
direct
 
comparison,
 
parents
 
more
 
often
 
selected
 
the
 
message
 
that
 
felt
 
better
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
seriousness
 
of
 
their
 
child’ s
 
anxiety
 
and
 
more
 
clearly
 
explained
 
how
 
care
 
would
 
work.
 
●
 
Recommendation:
 
Lead
 
with
 
Option
 
C
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
acquisition
 
message

Audience
 
Context
 
●
 
Parents
 
in
 
the
 
simulation
 
were
 
primary
 
decision-makers
 
for
 
children
 
aged
 
12-17,
 
most
 
of
 
whom
 
were
 
experiencing
 
moderate
 
to
 
severe
 
anxiety
 
●
 
The
 
audience
 
was
 
predominantly
 
mothers,
 
privately
 
insured,
 
higher
 
income,
 
concentrated
 
in
 
Massachusetts
 
and
 
the
 
broader
 
New
 
England
 
region,
 
and,
 
notably ,
 
open
 
to
 
virtual
 
care
 
for
 
their
 
child

Key
 
Findings
 
●
 
Likelihood
 
to
 
Prompt
 
Action
 
Higher
 
for
 
Option
 
C
 
○
 
The
 
most
 
decisive
 
signal
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
came
 
from
 
the
 
direct
 
forced-choice
 
question.
 
When
 
parents
 
had
 
to
 
choose
 
which
 
message
 
would
 
prompt
 
action,
 
Option
 
C
 
was
 
selected
 
by
 
50%
 
versus
 
24%
 
for
 
Option
 
A.
 
○
 
This
 
result
 
provides
 
the
 
strongest
 
basis
 
for
 
recommendation,
 
as
 
it
 
reflects
 
comparative
 
choice
 
rather
 
than
 
isolated
 
reactions
 
to
 
each
 
message
 
●
 
Motivation
 
to
 
Learn
 
More
 
Higher
 
for
 
Option
 
C
 
○
 
Both
 
messages
 
generated
 
moderate
 
to
 
high
 
motivation
 
overall,
 
but
 
Option
 
C
 
performed
 
better
 
○
 
On
 
a
 
five-point
 
motivation
 
scale,
 
57%
 
of
 
parents
 
rated
 
Option
 
C
 
as
 
“very”
 
or
 
“extremely
 
motivating,”
 
compared
 
to
 
50%
 
for
 
Option
 
A.
 
Option
 
C
 
also
 
achieved
 
a
 
higher
 
average
 
motivation
 
score
 
(3.6
 
vs
 
3.4).
 
○
 
In
 
open-ended
 
responses,
 
parents
 
reacting
 
positively
 
to
 
Option
 
C
 
more
 
often
 
referenced
 
understanding
 
how
 
care
 
would
 
work
 
in
 
practice,
 
particularly
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
support
 
between
 
sessions
 
and
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
a
 
defined
 
treatment
 
arc
 
○
 
By
 
contrast,
 
parents
 
responding
 
positively
 
to
 
Option
 
A
 
were
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
describe
 
the
 
message
 
as
 
reassuring
 
or
 
supportive
 
without
 
pointing
 
to
 
specific
 
operational
 
details
 
●
 
Concerns
 
About
 
Pursuing
 
Care
 
Similar
 
○
 
Levels
 
of
 
concern
 
were
 
broadly
 
similar
 
for
 
both
 
messages,
 
with
 
Option
 
A
 
at
 
2.7,
 
Option
 
C
 
at
 
2.6
 
on
 
a
 
5-point
 
concern
 
scale
 
○
 
Option
 
C
 
introduced
 
modest
 
concern
 
for
 
a
 
smaller
 
subset
 
of
 
parents,
 
primarily
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
specificity
 
of
 
claims
 
such
 
as
 
time-bound
 
treatment
 
and
 
exposure-based
 
work
 
○
 
Importantly ,
 
these
 
differences
 
in
 
concern
 
were
 
small
 
and
 
did
 
not
 
affect
 
overall
 
choice
 
behavior
 
○
 
Parents
 
were
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
act
 
on
 
the
 
message
 
that
 
provided
 
clearer
 
expectations
 
and
 
greater
 
confidence
 
in
 
effectiveness,
 
even
 
if
 
it
 
raised
 
additional
 
questions
 
●
 
Virtual
 
Care
 
Not
 
a
 
Barrier
 
But
 
Needs
 
a
 
Clear
 
Why
 
○
 
As
 
the
 
audience
 
was
 
defined
 
as
 
open
 
to
 
virtual
 
care,
 
we
 
did
 
not
 
expect
 
a
 
major
 
barrier
 
here
 
○
 
Roughly
 
¼
 
of
 
respondents
 
shared
 
some
 
level
 
of
 
discomfort
 
with
 
a
 
virtual
 
program
 
for
 
both
 
Options
 
A
 
and
 
C
 
○
 
However ,
 
Option
 
C
 
slightly
 
improves
 
comfort
 
by
 
explaining
 
why
 
virtual
 
delivery
 
matters
 
more
 
clearly
 
●
 
Clarity
 
and
 
Structure
 
Drive
 
Action
 
More
 
Than
 
Tone
 
Alone
 
○
 
Beyond
 
overall
 
preference,
 
the
 
pattern
 
across
 
responses
 
suggests
 
that
 
how
 
clearly
 
the
 
care
 
model
 
is
 
explained
 
matters
 
more
 
than
 
reassurance
 
alone
 
for
 
this
 
audience
 
○
 
Parents
 
responding
 
to
 
Option
 
C
 
more
 
consistently
 
pointed
 
to
 
specific
 
elements
 
of
 
how
 
care
 
would
 
work
 
in
 
practice,
 
such
 
as
 
what
 
happens

between
 
sessions,
 
how
 
skills
 
are
 
applied
 
in
 
real-world
 
situations,
 
and
 
how
 
progress
 
unfolds
 
over
 
time
 
○
 
By
 
contrast,
 
positive
 
reactions
 
to
 
Option
 
A
 
more
 
often
 
focused
 
on
 
feeling
 
supported
 
or
 
reassured,
 
without
 
referencing
 
concrete
 
aspects
 
of
 
treatment
 
delivery
 
○
 
This
 
distinction
 
helps
 
explain
 
why
 
Option
 
C
 
was
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
prompt
 
a
 
next
 
step:
 
parents
 
appear
 
more
 
willing
 
to
 
act
 
when
 
a
 
message
 
reduces
 
ambiguity
 
about
 
process
 
and
 
expectations,
 
even
 
if
 
it
 
introduces
 
additional
 
detail,
 
than
 
when
 
it
 
relies
 
primarily
 
on
 
tone
 
and
 
emotional
 
reassurance

Cross-Cutting
 
Language
 
Insights
 
and
 
Implications
 
for
 
Messaging
 
●
 
We
 
reviewed
 
open-ended
 
responses
 
across
 
message
 
options
 
to
 
identify
 
patterns
 
in
 
phrasing
 
that
 
consistently
 
resonated
 
with
 
parents,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
language
 
that
 
raised
 
confusion
 
or
 
concern
 
●
 
Language
 
That
 
Consistently
 
Resonated
 
○
 
Clarity
 
and
 
structure:
 
“A
 
clear
 
plan,”
 
“personalized
 
plan
 
and
 
clear
 
milestones,”
 
and
 
“visible
 
progress
 
markers”
 
helped
 
parents
 
feel
 
the
 
program
 
was
 
concrete
 
and
 
navigable
 
○
 
Real-world
 
skill
 
application:
 
Phrases
 
describing
 
skills
 
being
 
practiced
 
in
 
the
 
contexts
 
that
 
matter
 
(“real-world
 
moments,”
 
“live
 
practice,”
 
“immediate
 
use
 
of
 
skills”)
 
were
 
repeatedly
 
cited
 
as
 
credible
 
and
 
helpful
 
○
 
Expertise
 
and
 
comprehensive
 
support:
 
References
 
to
 
the
 
coordinated
 
team
 
–
 
therapist,
 
psychiatrist,
 
and
 
exposure
 
coach
 
–
 
and
 
coordination
 
with
 
family/school
 
reinforced
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
thoroughness
 
and
 
professionalism
 
○
 
Outcome-oriented
 
framing:
 
Language
 
such
 
as
 
“step
 
back
 
into
 
life
 
–
 
fast,”
 
“back
 
into
 
school,
 
friends,
 
and
 
everyday
 
life,”
 
and
 
“thoughtful
 
transition
 
plan”
 
communicated
 
progress
 
and
 
stability
 
after
 
treatment
 
○
 
Messaging
 
should
 
continue
 
to
 
emphasize
 
clarity ,
 
structure,
 
and
 
real-world
 
applicability ,
 
as
 
these
 
elements
 
meaningfully
 
enhance
 
parent
 
confidence
 
and
 
motivation
 
●
 
Language
 
to
 
Reconsider
 
or
 
Refine
 
○
 
Over-promising
 
or
 
sales-driven
 
tone:
 
Terms
 
like
 
“breakthrough
 
virtual
 
model”
 
or
 
comparisons
 
suggesting
 
in-office
 
treatment
 
is
 
“much
 
harder ,
 
if
 
not
 
impossible”
 
risked
 
sounding
 
exaggerated
 
○
 
Time-bound
 
language:
 
“Short,
 
time-limited
 
pathway ,”
 
“graduate
 
from
 
treatment,”
 
and
 
“graduate…
 
within
 
4-8
 
months”
 
created
 
worry
 
about
 
whether
 
the
 
program
 
might
 
be
 
too
 
rigid
 
or
 
too
 
fast
 
○
 
Safety
 
and
 
privacy
 
concerns:
 
Mentions
 
of
 
“live
 
exposure
 
practice,”
 
“coordinating
 
with
 
school,”
 
and
 
“support
 
during
 
and
 
between
 
sessions”
 
raised
 
questions
 
about
 
boundaries,
 
supervision,
 
and
 
confidentiality
 
○
 
Gimmicky
 
or
 
jargon-like
 
phrasing:
 
“Surround
 
sound
 
care
 
team”
 
and
 
unclear
 
terms
 
like
 
“tapers
 
in
 
intensity”
 
detracted
 
from
 
perceived
 
credibility
 
○
 
Messaging
 
can
 
preserve
 
the
 
underlying
 
concepts
 
while
 
adjusting
 
wording
 
to
 
maintain
 
credibility
 
and
 
reduce
 
perceptions

Conclusion
 
●
 
Based
 
on
 
this

Option
 
C

the
 
stronger
 
value

for
 
motivating
 
parents
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
next

toward
 
care

We
 
recommend
 
using
 
Option
 
C
 
as

with
 
Option
 
A
 
potentially
 
serving
 
as
 
a
 
tonal
 
reference
 
point
 
in
 
contexts
 
where
 
additional
 
reassurance
 
is
 
needed

When
 
anxiety
 
shrinks
 
your
 
child’ s
 
world,
 
they
 
need
 
care
 
that
 
meets
 
them
 
in
 
real
 
life
 
and
 
helps
 
them
 
step
 
back
 
into
 
life
 
–
 
fast.
 
 
InStride
 
Health’ s
 
virtual
 
model
 
of
 
real
‑
world
 
care
 
is
 
unlike
 
traditional
 
therapy
 
which
 
often
 
leaves
 
young
 
people
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
between
 
sessions,
 
making
 
it
 
challenging
 
for
 
new
 
skills
 
to
 
be
 
practiced
 
consistently .
 
At
 
InStride,
 
we
 
pair
 
real-time
 
support
 
during
 
and
 
between
 
sessions
 
with
 
time
‑
bound
 
skill
 
building,
 
to
 
help
 
forge
 
a
 
positive
 
new
 
path
 
for
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
child
 
and
 
enable
 
greater
 
confidence
 
in
 
achieving
 
success.
 
You’ll
 
have
 
a
 
clear
 
plan,
 
an
 
expert
 
team
 
beside
 
you,
 
and
 
visible
 
progress
 
markers
 
that
 
put
 
your
 
child
 
back
 
in
 
charge
 
of
 
anxious
 
moments
 
and
 
back
 
into
 
school,
 
friends,
 
and
 
everyday
 
life.

with

and
 
clear
 
milestones.
 
Following
 
an
 
evidence-based
 
approach
 
that
 
gradually
 
tapers
 
in
 
intensity ,
 
our
 
program
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
help
 
your
 
child
 
get
 
well
 
and
 
successfully
 
graduate
 
from
 
InStride’ s
 
treatment
 
within
 
4-8
 
months.

Real-W orld
 
Application:
 
Clinician-guided
 
immersion
 
ensures
 
live
 
exposure
 
practice
 
and
 
immediate
 
use
 
of
 
skills
 
in
 
the
 
real-world
 
moments
 
and
 
environments
 
(e.g.,
 
school,
 
home,
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
community)
 
that
 
matter
 
most.
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
exposures
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
harder ,
 
if
 
not
 
impossible,
 
to
 
practice
 
if
 
treatment
 
were
 
in
 
office.
