Simulation
 
of

2026
 
C-Suite
 
Outlook
 
Survey

Introduction
 
This
 
document
 
presents
 
a
 
Crowdwave
 
simulation
 
of
 
The
 
Conference
 
Board’s
 
2026
 
C-Suite
 
Outlook
 
survey.
 
Using
 
a
 
sample
 
of
 
10
 
questions
 
with
 
TCB’s
 
question
 
structure
 
and
 
response
 
options,
 
we
 
simulated
 
responses
 
from
 
a
 
CEO-only
 
audience
 
to
 
examine
 
whether
 
relative
 
rankings
 
and
 
thematic
 
signals
 
align
 
with
 
patterns
 
observed
 
in
 
the
 
human
 
survey.
 
While
 
the
 
simulated
 
sample
 
differs
 
from
 
the
 
original
 
study
 
in
 
composition
 
and
 
completion
 
behavior,
 
the
 
intent
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
directional,
 
complementary
 
lens
 
on
 
executive
 
sentiment.

“Fielding”
 
timing:
 
Simulated
 
sentiment
 
based
 
on
 
perspectives
 
on
 
Dec

2025
 
(vs.
 
TCB’s
 
longer
 
fielding
 
period)
 
*
 
Audience
 
(different
 
than
 
the
 
TCB
 
study):
 
 
○
 
Sample
 
size
:
 
500
 
simulated
 
respondents
 
○
 
Role
:
 
CEOs
 
only
 
(other
 
C-Suite
 
positions
 
excluded)
 
○
 
Geography
:
 
Equal
 
distribution
 
of
 
1/3
 
US,
 
1/3
 
Europe,
 
and
 
1/3
 
Asia
 
○
 
Sector
:
 
49%
 
of
 
respondents
 
are
 
based
 
in
 
business
 
and
 
professional
 
services,
 
38.8%
 
in
 
manufacturing
 
industries,
 
and
 
12.2%
 
in
 
financial
 
services
 
○
 
Company
 
size
:
 
$100M+
 
annual
 
revenue
 
*
 
Completion
 
rates
:
 
100%
 
completion
 
for
 
all
 
questions,
 
including
 
providing
 
two
 
choices
 
when
 
asked
 
(human
 
responses
 
often
 
choose
 
only
 
one),
 
which
 
may
 
inflate
 
the
 
figures
 
for
 
the
 
questions
 
1-8,
 
11.
 
*
 
“Other”
 
option
 
removal
:
 
Removed
 
“other”
 
options
 
as
 
it
 
depended
 
on
 
open-ended
 
responses
 
with
 
low
 
frequency.
  
 
*
 
Survey
 
structure
:
 
Many
 
question
 
options
 
are
 
not
 
MECE
 
(mutually
 
exclusive,
 
collectively
 
exhaustive)
 
with
 
overlapping
 
/
 
similar
 
options.
 
For
 
example,
 
“labor
 
costs”
 
and
 
“headcount”
 
were
 
both
 
options
 
in
 
the
 
profitability
 
increase
 
question.
 
This
 
makes
 
it
 
challenging
 
for
 
both
 
humans
 
and
 
simulated
 
respondents
 
to
 
provide
 
clear
 
responses.
 
There
 
were
 
also
 
terms
 
such
 
as
 
“uncertainty”
 
that
 
are
 
a
 
bit
 
vague
 
for
 
surveys.
 
*
 
Rounding
:
 
Numbers
 
are
 
rounded
 
to
 
avoid
 
false
 
precision,
 
with
 
several
 
options
 
tying
 
as
 
a
 
result.
 
 
Key
 
Survey
 
Themes
 
 
1.
 
Cost
 
pressure
 
and
 
pricing
 
decisions
 
are
 
front
 
and
 
center
 
*
 
The
 
economic
 
risks
 
are
 
clustered
 
around
 
cost
 
of
 
capital
 
and
 
input
 
pressure:
 
inflation
 
(28%),
 
interest
 
rates
 
(26%),
 
and
 
tariffs
 
(25%)
 
lead
 
the
 
list,
 
with
 
downturn/recession
 
also
 
close
 
(24%)
 
*
 
That
 
shows
 
up
 
again
 
in
 
trade
 
expectations:
 
supply
 
chain
 
disruptions
 
are
 
the
 
top
 
trade-war
 
impact
 
(40%)
 
and
 
“having
 
to
 
raise
 
prices
 
due
 
to
 
tariffs”
 
is
 
second
 
(33%)

*
 
On
 
profitability,
 
CEOs
 
are
 
consistent
 
with
 
that
 
picture:
 
the
 
top
 
levers
 
are
 
labor
 
costs
 
(38%)
 
and
 
price
 
increases
 
(36%),
 
with
 
headcount
 
and
 
business
 
model
 
changes
 
(30%
 
each)
 
 
2.
 
Regulation
 
and
 
policy
 
are
 
built
 
into
 
how
 
CEOs
 
expect
 
to
 
operate
 
*
 
Industry
 
and
 
market
 
dynamics
 
are
 
led
 
by
 
regulation
 
in
 
primary
 
markets
 
(40%)
 
and
 
protectionism
 
(36%),
 
followed
 
by
 
regulatory
 
divergence
 
(28%)
 
and
 
global
 
minimum
 
tax
 
implementation
 
(27%)
 
*
 
The
 
governance
 
lens
 
reinforces
 
the
 
same
 
concern:
 
political
 
uncertainty
 
(36%)
 
and
 
public
 
policy
 
shifts
 
(31%)
 
are
 
the
 
top
 
two,
 
with
 
evolving
 
AI
 
regulation
 
and
 
governance
 
requirements
 
also
 
high
 
(26%)
 
 
3.
 
Cybersecurity
 
is
 
top
 
standalone
 
security
 
concern
 
 
*
 
On
 
security,
 
cyberattacks
 
are
 
clearly
 
the
 
top
 
item
 
(50%),
 
materially
 
ahead
 
of
 
any
 
single
 
armed-conflict
 
region
 
(Europe
 
28%,
 
Asia-Pacific
 
27%,
 
Middle
 
East
 
26%)
 
*
 
Although,
 
of
 
note,
 
when
 
adding
 
all
 
armed-conflict
 
regions
 
that
 
category
 
becomes
 
the
 
top
 
security
 
issue
 
 
4.
 
AI
 
is
 
a
 
core
 
operating
 
and
 
investment
 
priority
 
*
 
AI
 
is
 
the
 
leading
 
societal
 
and
 
technological
 
factor
 
affecting
 
business,
 
cited
 
by
 
42%
 
of
 
CEOs
 
*
 
AI
 
is
 
also
 
the
 
top
 
investment
 
priority,
 
cited
 
by
 
40%,
 
ahead
 
of
 
customer
 
experience
 
and
 
talent
 
(both
 
29%)
 
*
 
AI-related
 
governance
 
requirements
 
cited
 
by
 
26%,
 
indicating
 
that
 
adoption
 
and
 
oversight
 
are
 
advancing
 
together
 
 
5.
 
Capability
 
and
 
adoption
 
are
 
the
 
internal
 
bottlenecks
 
*
 
The
 
leading
 
human-capital
 
issues
 
are
 
finding
 
qualified
 
workers
 
(34%),
 
lack
 
of
 
in-demand
 
skills
 
(27%),
 
and
 
adoption
 
of
 
new
 
technologies
 
(25%)
 
*
 
Notably,
 
impact
 
of
 
automation
 
(including
 
AI)
 
is
 
also
 
cited
 
at
 
21%,
 
tying
 
the
 
talent
 
story
 
directly
 
to
 
the
 
technology
 
story
 
 
6.
 
Growth
 
and
 
investment
 
remain
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
core
 
business
 
*
 
The
 
top
 
expansion
 
arena
 
is
 
customer
 
segments
 
(33%),
 
followed
 
by
 
product
 
categories
 
(30%);
 
distribution
 
channels
 
are
 
a
 
distant
 
third
 
(18%)
 
*
 
Investment
 
priorities
 
support
 
this
 
approach.
 
The
 
highest
 
levels
 
of
 
investment
 
are
 
directed
 
toward
 
capabilities
 
that
 
improve
 
how
 
the
 
current
 
business
 
operates
 
and
 
serves
 
customers.
 
AI
 
and
 
technology
 
lead
 
at
 
40%,
 
followed
 
by
 
customer
 
experience
 
and
 
talent
 
at
 
29%
 
each,
 
and
 
product
 
and
 
service
 
innovation
 
at
 
26%.
