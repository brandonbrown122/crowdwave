## Accuracy Framework Application

### Prior Data Available
| Construct | Source | Date | Relevance (1-5) |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Calibrations to Apply
| Bias Pattern | Adjustment | Rationale |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| | | |
| | | |

### Confidence Factors
- [ ] Strong prior data available (3+ sources)
- [ ] Audience matches validated segments
- [ ] Topic is stable (not fast-changing)
- [ ] Question types are high-accuracy zones
- [ ] No polarized political content

**Overall Confidence Score:** [0.5 - 0.9]

---

## Methodology

### Phase 2: Anchoring Priors
We will search for benchmark data on:
- [Construct 1]
- [Construct 2]
- [Construct 3]

### Phase 5: Ensemble Simulation
Three independent runs:
- **Run 1 (40%):** Conservative, anchor on priors
- **Run 2 (35%):** Signal-forward, assume stimulus effects
- **Run 3 (25%):** Heterogeneity, model variance

### Phase 7: Confidence Calibration
Each question scored based on:
- Prior strength
- Run agreement
- Domain accuracy history

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Format | Timing |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Simulated data file | CSV | [Date] |
| Methodology trace | JSON | [Date] |
| Summary report | PDF | [Date] |
| Confidence scores | Per question | Included |

## Validation Recommendation

Based on accuracy framework analysis:

**Simulation-only (no validation needed):**
- [List questions with high confidence]

**Recommend validation sample:**
- [List questions requiring real respondent validation]
- Suggested N: [Sample size]
- Estimated cost: [Range]

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **Intent-action gap:** Purchase intent questions will have ×0.30 conversion applied
2. **[Specific limitation for this project]**
3. **[Specific limitation for this project]**
