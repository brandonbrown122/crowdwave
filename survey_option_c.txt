When
 
anxiety
 
shrinks
 
your
 
child’s
 
world,
 
they
 
need
 
care
 
that
 
meets
 
them
 
in
 
real
 
life
 
and
 
helps
 
them
 
step
 
back
 
into
 
life
 
–
 
fast.
 
 
InStride
 
Health’s
 
virtual
 
model
 
of
 
real
‑
world
 
care
 
is
 
unlike
 
traditional
 
therapy
 
which
 
often
 
leaves
 
young
 
people
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
between
 
sessions,
 
making
 
it
 
challenging
 
for
 
new
 
skills
 
to
 
be
 
practiced
 
consistently.
 
At
 
InStride,
 
we
 
pair
 
real-time
 
support
 
during
 
and
 
between
 
sessions
 
with
 
time
‑
bound
 
skill
 
building,
 
to
 
help
 
forge
 
a
 
positive
 
new
 
path
 
for
 
you
 
and
 
your
 
child
 
and
 
enable
 
greater
 
confidence
 
in
 
achieving
 
success.
 
You’ll
 
have
 
a
 
clear
 
plan,
 
an
 
expert
 
team
 
beside
 
you,
 
and
 
visible
 
progress
 
markers
 
that
 
put
 
your
 
child
 
back
 
in
 
charge
 
of
 
anxious
 
moments
 
and
 
back
 
into
 
school,
 
friends,
 
and
 
everyday
 
life.
 
 
How
 
it
 
works:
 
●
 
Goal-Driven
 
&
 
Time-Bound:
 
A
 
purposefully
 
time-limited
 
pathway
 
with
 
a
 
personalized
 
plan
 
and
 
clear
 
milestones.
 
Following
 
an
 
evidence-based
 
approach
 
that
 
gradually
 
tapers
 
in
 
intensity,
 
our
 
program
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
help
 
your
 
child
 
get
 
well
 
and
 
successfully
 
graduate
 
from
 
InStride’s
 
treatment
 
within
 
4-8
 
months.
 
●
 
Real-World
 
Application:
 
Clinician-guided
 
immersion
 
ensures
 
live
 
exposure
 
practice
 
and
 
immediate
 
use
 
of
 
skills
 
in
 
the
 
real-world
 
moments
 
and
 
environments
 
(e.g.,
 
school,
 
home,
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
community)
 
that
 
matter
 
most.
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
exposures
 
would
 
be
 
much
 
harder,
 
if
 
not
 
impossible,
 
to
 
practice
 
if
 
treatment
 
were
 
in
 
office.
 
 
●
 
Coordinated
 
Expert
 
Team:
 
A
 
dedicated
 
care
 
team
 
of
 
three
 
experts
 
–
 
therapist,
 
psychiatrist,
 
and
 
exposure
 
coach
 
–
 
coordinating
 
seamlessly
 
with
 
each
 
other,
 
your
 
family,
 
existing
 
providers,
 
and
 
school
 
as
 
appropriate.
 
●
 
Family
 
Partnership:
 
Practical
 
tools
 
and
 
family
 
involvement
 
to
 
effectively
 
support
 
progress
 
between
 
sessions.
 
●
 
Sustained
 
Success:
 
A
 
thoughtful
 
transition
 
plan
 
designed
 
to
 
sustain
 
gains
 
after
 
the
 
program
 
ends.
