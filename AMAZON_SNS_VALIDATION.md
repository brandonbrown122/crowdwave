## 5. Validation Summary

### Data Quality Notes
- 52 interviews conducted; 50 with complete quantitative data
- 2 records missing NPS/satisfaction scores
- Some satisfaction dimensions have slight n variance (46-50)
- All verbatim fields populated (50 responses each for likes/dislikes)

### Key Findings for Validation
1. **Strong NPS**: +36 is healthy; half are promoters
2. **Core experience rated highly**: Ordering (4.38) and Ease of Use (4.30) lead
3. **Opportunity areas**: Notifications (3.74), Flexibility (3.84) trail
4. **Behavioral reality**: Users spend ~$99/month, S&S is ~15% of total HH spend
5. **Engaged sample**: Average 2.5+ years tenure with S&S

### Thematic Validation
- **Convenience** is the dominant value driver (consistent with behavioral lock-in)
- **Over-delivery/frequency mismatch** is the top friction point
- Price sensitivity exists but doesn't drive detractors (only 14% detractors)
