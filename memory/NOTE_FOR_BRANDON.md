**Re:** Crowdwave UI Access

Jeremy asked me to make sure **@bb12268** has access to the Crowdwave simulator UI.

Since the app is local-only and has no auth, you'll need to either:

1. **Quick share:** Start the app + localtunnel and send them the URL
2. **Permanent access:** Deploy somewhere (Vercel, Railway, etc.) and share the link

Let Jeremy know once it's set up!
